# Covid switzerland checker

Switzerland bases its list of dangerous countries on the difference of new cases compared to Switzerland. If the country has more than 60 new cases per 100.000 citizens more than Switzerland, the country is added to the list.

I made a little tool to check if the Netherlands is on the list. It could easily be extended to more countries and with a more pleasant view (little Angular wrapper or similar). It uses data from Our World in Data: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data .
